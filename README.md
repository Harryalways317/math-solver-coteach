### Problem Statement ðŸ’¡ :

Build a chatbot API that is able to ingest images or text by a user. The chatbot should be able to fetch accurate YouTube links and respond to the user while answering their query on the chat.

### Tech Stack ðŸ’»

Python
Fast API
Crew AI (Simple Orchestration)
Youtube API (Retriving Videos)
Vision GPT API (Analyzing the text in images) -> (if low accuracy is fine, we can use OCR and then ingest text to GPT)
